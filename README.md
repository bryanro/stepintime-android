Description
===========

Step in Time allows you to set step count goals throughout the day and sends you notifications on progress throughout the day based on those goals.


Setup and Build
===============

* Rename the app/src/main/res/values/auth.xml.template file to auth.xml (remove the ".template") and enter the values from dev.fitbit.com.
* Build the app and deploy to your Android phone.
* The first time you open the app, it should automatically navigate to the settings page, where you should click the Authorize App button.  The fitbit webpage will open and ask you to confirm the authorization.
* Once you're done, setup your schedule on the app's main page by adding times and step counts.
